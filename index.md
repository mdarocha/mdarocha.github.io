# :wave: Hey there!

My name is Marek.

Professionally, I'm a fullstack web developer using mostly the .NET platform
on the backend, and Angular or React on the frontend. I'm also not scared of using
new tools when the need arises :wink:.

I'm also interested in implementing DevOps processes and automation. I love
having my application builds fully automated and my infrastructure defined in
Ansible and Terraform. This led me to the [NixOS project](https://nixos.org/),
which I use on all my personal machines.

In my free time, I contribute to some open source projects, mostly maintaining
several packages in [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs).

## Some of my more interesting public projects

- [nix-qutebrowser-overlays](https://github.com/mdarocha/nix-qutebrowser-overlays) -
  a set of nixpkgs overlays, allowing you to use
  [qutebrowser](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser) with tree style
  tabs (similar to the original Firefox extension)

- [nuget-packageslock2nix](https://github.com/mdarocha/nuget-packageslock2nix) (better name pending) -
  a helper function, allowing you to build .NET projects in Nix without having to generate
  separate Nix dependency definitions, by using the `packages.lock.json` files that can be
  generated in newer .NET versions.

- [Docker.DotNet fork](https://github.com/TrapTech/Docker.DotNet) with added support for connecting over SSH
