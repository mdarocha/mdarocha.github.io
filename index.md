# :wave: Hey there!

My name is Marek.

Professionally, I'm a full stack web developer using the .NET platform,
Angular and React. I also have quite a bit
of experience with Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, and I consider myself
knowledgeable about Linux - all my personal devices run it where possible.

I love automation  and embracing the DevOps process, writing helper
scripts for everything I can. I love having my application builds fully
automated and my infrastructure defined in a Git repository :smile:.

In my free time, I'm a contributor to the [NixOS project](https://nixos.org/),
focusing mostly on improving the .NET user experience in Nix, and maintaining
[a few packages](https://repology.org/maintainers/?search=marek%40mdarocha.pl).

I'm also a maintainer of [Terranix](https://terranix.org/) - a new, Nix-native
way to define your Terraform infrastructure.

You can email me at <a title="Email" href="#" data-email_b64="bWFyZWtAbWRhcm9jaGEucGwK"></a>.
It's a catch-all address, so you can substitute the part before `@` for
anything you like. It helps me organize my mail :wink:.

## Some of my projects

- [nuget-packageslock2nix](https://github.com/mdarocha/nuget-packageslock2nix) (better name pending) -
  a helper function, allowing you to build .NET projects in Nix without having to generate
  separate Nix dependency definitions, by using the `packages.lock.json` files that can be
  generated in newer .NET versions.
