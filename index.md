# :wave: Hey there!

My name is Marek.

Professionally, I'm a full stack web developer using mostly the .NET platform
on the backend, and Angular or React on the frontend. I also have quite a bit
of experience with Azure, and I'm a huge fan of IaC, having a lot of experience
with Terraform.

I'm really love automation  and embracing the DevOps process, writing helper
scripts for everything I can. I love having my application builds fully
automated and my infrastructure defined in a Git repository :smile:.

In my free time, I'm a contributor to the [NixOS project](https://nixos.org/),
focusing mostly on improving the .NET user experience in Nix, and maintaining
[a few packages](https://repology.org/maintainers/?search=marek%40mdarocha.pl).

I'm also a maintainer of [Terranix](https://terranix.org/) - a new, Nix-native
way to define your Terraform infrastructure.

You can email me at [marek@mdarocha.pl](mailto:marek@mdarocha.pl). It's a catch-all address,
so you can substitute the part before `@` for anything you like. It helps me organize my mail :).

## Some of my projects

- [nuget-packageslock2nix](https://github.com/mdarocha/nuget-packageslock2nix) (better name pending) -
  a helper function, allowing you to build .NET projects in Nix without having to generate
  separate Nix dependency definitions, by using the `packages.lock.json` files that can be
  generated in newer .NET versions.
