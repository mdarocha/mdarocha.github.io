# 👋 Hey there!

My name is Marek.

You can email me at <a title="Email" href="#" data-email_b64="bWFyZWtAbWRhcm9jaGEucGwK"></a>.
It's a catch-all address, so you can substitute the part before `@` for
anything you like.

## Some links

- [my github profile](https://github.com/mdarocha)

## Some of my projects

- [nuget-packageslock2nix](https://github.com/mdarocha/nuget-packageslock2nix) (better name pending) -
  a helper function, allowing you to build .NET projects in Nix without having to generate
  separate Nix dependency definitions, by using the `packages.lock.json` files that can be
  generated in newer .NET versions.
